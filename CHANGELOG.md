# Venworks Debug Tools

## Version 1.0.2
* Using the new travel helpers from Venworks Core

## Version 1.0.1
* Adding a fast travel console in the interior debug cell but its not triggering the scripts but doesn't hurt anything either. Sp leaving while I work on it. Ultimately it will be the injectable terminal I'm working on for Venworks Core. 
* Added a form list and message menu for a new console command that will let you fast travel to your own cells and the debug cells for development and testing of the cells. See the new stuff in the Usage section, the new article or the Readme.MD file on the GitHub site. 
* Remove the other debug commands that VPDT_Debug.FastTravelLocations has replaced and updated the help
* Please note I'm working on the lighting but frankly the beta also fixes it so may have to wait :/ 

## Version 1.0.0
* Initial Release
