# Venworks Debug Tools

## Version 1.0.5
* Added papyrus checks for the plugins not being loaded before using Game.GetFormByFile()
* You can use the current overridden object method or the new [Real Time Form Patcher](https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/mods/8324) method to add custom fast travel destinations. 

## Version 1.0.4
* Totally screwed up and put the entrance at the exit /facepalm
* Added more light poles at the entrance and another over the workstations
* Added more hab lighting 

## Version 1.0.3
* World Space recreated on a real terrain with water support
* World space cell has hab with all benches not. 
* Renamed the cells to reference Venworks vs Venpi as more them 1 author is playing in the code now days. 
* Debug cell and been completely redone and now has viable lighting stupid debug walls were destroying the lighting. Overtime it will probably become a full cave with 2 habs

## Version 1.0.2
* Using the new travel helpers from Venworks Core

## Version 1.0.1
* Adding a fast travel console in the interior debug cell but its not triggering the scripts but doesn't hurt anything either. Sp leaving while I work on it. Ultimately it will be the injectable terminal I'm working on for Venworks Core. 
* Added a form list and message menu for a new console command that will let you fast travel to your own cells and the debug cells for development and testing of the cells. See the new stuff in the Usage section, the new article or the Readme.MD file on the GitHub site. 
* Remove the other debug commands that VPDT_Debug.FastTravelLocations has replaced and updated the help
* Please note I'm working on the lighting but frankly the beta also fixes it so may have to wait :/ 

## Version 1.0.0
* Initial Release
